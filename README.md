# Wash4Wellness: Empowering Healthy Institutions

## The Problem

Institutions like universities lack efficient ways to track and gather information about the health of their users or students. This gap hinders their ability to promote and maintain a healthy community.

## Our Solution

Wash4Wellness addresses this challenge with a comprehensive platform featuring both admin health panels and user panels. This dual approach allows for:

1. Individual health tracking for users
2. Health gamification through admin-created challenges

## Key Features

### User View

1. **Streamlined Sign-In Process**: 
   - Easy registration and secure authentication
   - Quick profile setup to capture health interests

2. **Personal Goal Setting**: 
   - Users can create and track individual health objectives

3. **Interest-Based Challenges**: 
   - Automatic assignment to challenges based on user interests
   - Team competitions (e.g., Class of 2025 CS vs. Class of 2024 CS)

4. **Challenge Insights**: 
   - View detailed challenge information
   - Track personal contributions
   - See top contributors and team standings

### Admin View

1. **Challenge Creation**: 
   - Set up new health challenges
   - Customize challenge parameters and goals

2. **User Management**: 
   - Promote users to admin status
   - Oversee user accounts and team assignments

3. **Challenge Overview**: 
   - View all active and past challenges
   - Access participation statistics and health trends

## How It Works

1. Users sign up and set their health interests
2. Admins create engaging health challenges
3. Users are automatically assigned to relevant challenges and teams
4. Participants log their activities and track progress
5. Admins monitor overall health trends and challenge success

## üõ† Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose
- **Authentication/API**: SendGrid
- **Frontend**: React-Native

## Future Vision

While our MVP is tailored for Washington University, Wash4Wellness is designed with scalability in mind. Our goal is to extend this platform to businesses, educational institutions, and organizations worldwide, creating a global movement towards better organizational health.

## Impact

Wash4Wellness enables institutions to:
- Gain real-time insights into community health
- Foster a culture of wellness through friendly competition
- Make data-driven decisions to improve overall health initiatives
